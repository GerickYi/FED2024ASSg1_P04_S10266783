Overview: The reason why I chose to do a Pet Care Shop/Cfe is a very simple reason, I was walking one day when I saw a pet cafe which provided services to owners who brought their pet along with them and that piqued my interest which caused to make a project about a Pet Care Shop/Cafe which I based heavily offed what I saw that day.

The website was made for the younger generation in mind as it includes things that they do that the older generation does not do which is online shopping and using social media. Also the younger generation prefer to liva a single life rather than one with partners so I hoped that this website may also inspire them to try their hand at living somebody other than themselves like pets then maybe a paartner that they wish to start kids with as many people treat their pets as their children.

Features of the project: Search bar a usual thing to see on a website. Navigator below bar to help change pages that show specific things related to the website like reviews, and their contact information. Hyperlinks in contact details to help customer or potential customers contact the store to ask questions or make a appointment for services provided by the store. Being able to make a review, allow the customer to let the store know about their experience and what they believe can be improved.
Features left to implement: an actual working search bar and a working online shop.

Technologies used: ChatGpt and Codeium, both were used for the same reason, to either hel fix errors in code or help create certain parts to link codes that I was unable to do so myself like the stars.
